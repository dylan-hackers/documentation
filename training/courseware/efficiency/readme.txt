This directory contains the following files and subdirectories.

File				Description
----				-----------

readme.txt			This file
Efficiency.doc			Presentation "slides" as MS Word doc
Efficiency.txt			Notes for presentation and practical
inefficient [dir]			Simple example of inefficiency
  done [dir]			Same example, made more efficient
life [dir]			The Life example from the release
  done [dir]			Same example, made more efficient


* Notes

The Life example is included here despite still being available in
the release because I believe the release version has now been made more
efficient (or may be made so at some point).

Instructions for the profiler (as used in the training) can be found in HOPE
in D-doc-misc!devel-dbg-instructions.text(trunk.7).
