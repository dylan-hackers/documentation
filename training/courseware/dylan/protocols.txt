[I can't remember if we really got on to discussing this.]

library/protocol/in-the-large issues, e.g,

  o  interface/implementation
    o  interface (open, abstract classes/GFs)
       & implementation (closed, sealed classes/domains) libraries
    o  e.g., tables and vectors in the Dylan library
    o  give example of "delegating" make method
  o  abstract vs. concrete (Kim Barret sez)
    o  never have concrete non-leaf classes, because you can't
       add abstract subclasses later
