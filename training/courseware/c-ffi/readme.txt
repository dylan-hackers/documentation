ffi-practical-2.rtf		} The 3 C-FFI praticals
ffi-practical-3.rtf		}
ffi-presentation.rtf		Presentation "slides" as an RTF file


* Notes

The RTF files are best viewed in (and printed from) MS Word or the free Word
Viewer but you can also use WordPad (which has the advantage that's it's
installed in Win95/NT4 by default).

The three projects
  status-buttons		Application using libraries below
  status-icons		Dylan-level library for "NotifyIcon"
  win32-taskbar		C-FFI wrapper library for "NotifyIcon"
mentioned in the practicals can be found in HOPE compounds under
  D-examples-c-ffi-taskbar-icons

The file "c-status-buttons.exe" mentioned in the third practical was indeed
just a "Make Release" of the project, so future trainees should just do that
instead.
