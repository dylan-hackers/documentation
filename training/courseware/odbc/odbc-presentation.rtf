\par 
\par The SQL interface is carefully structured to allow most code to be written independent of the particular implementation library being used. The same code could be used in the same program to connect to different kinds of database

\par There may potentially be more than one connection open at any one time on a single database
\par 
\par Connections are opened by calling the {\b connect} function with a database object and a user object \endash  {\b make} should not be called directly on subclasses of {\b <connection>}
