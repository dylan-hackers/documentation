This directory contains the following files.

readme.txt			This file
DUIM.doc				Presentation "slides" as MS Word doc
DUIM.txt				Notes for presentation and practical

In DUIM.doc, the slides for the second session start with the one headed
"DUIM in More Detail".

In the training, this directory included the DUIM "Win32 Resources" example.
However, that is now included with the product and it's not important to
keep the version we used then, as it was just as a proof-of-concept to show
that resource support worked.
