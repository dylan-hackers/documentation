DEBUGGING IN THE EMULATOR

The LispWorks debugging tools work well enough on Dylan functions and
methods, give or take having to look past some name mangling. 

The LispWorks tracing facilities are made available through the
listener commands:

  trace:      name [(type, ...)] ;
  trace-here: name [(type, ...)] ;
  break:      name [(type, ...)] ;
  break-here: name [(type, ...)] ;

See the listener commands documentation for a more detailed
description.
