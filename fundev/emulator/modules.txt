MODULES IN THE EMULATOR

The commands:

  in:    [module-name] ;
  which: [name] ;

are provided to help you navigate the module system in the emulator.
See the listener commands documentation for a more detailed
description. 

In addition, the emulator provides the special form "access" for
getting at variables without having to abide by module interface
restrictions. Its syntax is:

  access(module-name, variable-name) => value

It returns the value the variable called variable-name has in the
module module-name. 

The emulator has a single module name space, using libraries only in
a system-like way, so a library argument to access isn't needed.
