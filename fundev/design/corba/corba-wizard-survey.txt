Summary:

	CORBA Interface Wizard

	Effectively a UI to an IDL compiler. Let's users select
	interfaces from IDL file or interface repository and generates
	stubs and skeletons. Usually supports Application language choices
	like which module to put generated code in. Sometimes also supports

One of the many new features to be incorporated in the next version of
Parts is the CORBA Wizard. The CORBA Wizard allows the developer to
browse a CORBA repository and select the objects with which an
application will communicate. A single mouse-click automatically
generates and compiles Java source code for connecting to the
object. The resulting classes can then be added to the developer's
workbench and wired with other elements in the same manner as local
objects. It is not necessary for users to address

These features enhance the capabilities and functionality of HP ORB
Plus 2.0, which is HP's CORBA 2.0-compliant C object-request broker
for HP-UX, Sun Solaris and Windows NT platforms. The enterprise
wizards allow Visual C developers to create CORBA objects that can be
deployed on Windows NT or HP-UX platforms. The wizards are designed to
simplify development by automating repetitive tasks. The application
wizard guides the Visual C++ developer through the basic decision
points related to the development of a CORBA server object and then
generates a skeleton application source code. The naming-insertion
wizard simplifies development of functionalities for naming services
for Windows clients in a CORBA client/server environment. The wizard
generates all the source code needed to link clients and CORBA server
components.

The Parts for Java/OrbixWeb combo will also include wizards for
building CORBA-compliant Java applications. A CORBA Wizard will let
developers browse a CORBA repository and select the objects with which
their application can communicate. All underlying communications
software is generated automatically, turning one of the most difficult
CORBA development tasks into a simple point-and-click operation.

HP ORB Plus 2.0 Enterprise Wizards 

The HP-developed enterprise wizards for HP ORB Plus 2.0 allow Visual
C++ developers to create CORBA objects that can be deployed on Windows
NT or HP-UX platforms. The wizards are designed to simplify
development by automating often-repeated tasks.

At Object World West, HP is demonstrating an application wizard and a
naming-insertion wizard. The application wizard guides the Visual C++
developer through the basic decision points related to the development
of a CORBA server object and then generates a skeleton application
source code. The naming-insertion wizard simplifies development of
functionalities for naming services for Windows clients in a CORBA
client/server environment. The wizard generates all the source code
needed to link clients and CORBA server components.

"We are exploiting the features of Windows-based development
environments so that developers can create solutions using CORBA
components," said Cyndi Nickel, product line manager at HP's
Enterprise Objects Program. "Our goal is to support the development of
mixed-mode solutions that incorporate OLE and CORBA object models
across UNIX system and Windows platforms."

Before using Jolt Wizard, you need to install all the software
applications you will be using during your development effort,
including the Contract Repository and any Application Development
Environment tools.

During development, the programmer uses the Jolt Wizard to enhance
his/her productivity in creating Jolt clients. The Wizard is used to
perform a number of important tasks:

1.View all client/server interface definitions in the Contract Repository. 

2.Generate and compile client interface classes ("stubs") on the workstation. 

3.Create sample Java source code for using the stub API. 

The client stubs present a CORBA-compliant API to the programmer. The
stubs, in turn, use the native Jolt API to communicate with TUXEDO
services. The stub generation process can be enhanced to implement
application-specific features in the generated stub source. Also, the
stub API has been designed to be completely thread-safe.

The Jolt Wizard provides several static classes (not generated) used
for CORBA compliance and TUXEDO session logon, security access, and
transaction control. The Session, CurrentContext, and
BEA_Principal_Authenticator classes are used to logon to TUXEDO. The
COSTransaction.Current object is also used to perform transaction
control (ie., begin(), commit()).

Have a look at http://www.zurich.ibm.com/~bba/dsom_interpreter.html for
a beast that does the same for IBM's (D)SOM ...
