* Introduction

This document describes the "key bindings" or "shortcut keys" used in 
the various environment tools.

The bindings are listed by menu and menu item.  Commands in "()" are
not currently available in the Environment, but may be in the future.

* Other windows

The following other windows exist in the environment but have no
menus, and hence no shortcut keys.

  - Initial dialog
  - New Project wizard
  - Advanced Build dialog
  - Various "Options" dialogs


* Binding-to-command mapping

The following table lists the various possible key combinations and
the commands they map to.  It's sort of the inverse of the
menu-item-to-binding mapping in the previous sections, but it covers
some commands which don't (currently) have any bindings.  I've also
included notes of keys which are reserved or conventionally used by
Windows for other purposes.

You'll have to make your editor _really_wide_ to see this list
properly!

This table also only covers the "Windows keyboard layout" for Deuce.
The Emacs layout is a law unto itself!


** Key

"#" = clash between env and Deuce.
"[]" indicate functions reserved by Windows.
"()" indicate commands unimplemented (or implemented but not actually
  bound to that key)
"(... ...)" indicate general ideas for future assignments.
[D] = Only in Dylan-mode (in Deuce)
[S] = Only in Shell-mode (i.e., in the interactor/debugger)

** Clashes with Deuce:
	Env has ...		Deuce has ...		On key ...
	(Edit/ReplaceSel)	query-replace-str	Ctrl+H

  Suggested fixes:
	query-replace-str	Drop if we get the new Find dialog integrated
	(Edit/Replace)		Ctrl+H, if the new Find dialog is in; drop if not

** Bindings unimplemented in Deuce (Windows keyboard layout):
	[All the old Windows cut/copy/paste keys, e.g., Ctrl+Ins]
