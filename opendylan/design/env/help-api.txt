* INTRODUCTION

The DUIM-FRAMES library includes an abstract model of driving a help
system, originally based on Microsoft's WinHelp API. These commands
provides a high level interface to controlling and filling an external
help viewer.

The following document describes these commands and some ancillary
functions. It also provides an simple example of how to use them. All
the bindings are exported from the DUIM-FRAMES library via the
DUIM-FRAMES module.

* FUNCTIONS

--------------------------------------------------

Name:		FRAME-HELP-SOURCE			[Open Generic Function]

Signature:	FRAME-HELP-SOURCE FRAME => SOURCE

Arguments:	FRAME	<FRAME>		The frame help is being invoked on.

Values:		SOURCE	<HELP-SOURCE> or <SYMBOL>	The help source to use.

Description:	Called by the system to determine the help source to use
		for the frame. The default method searches up the
		sheet parent hierarchy from a given pane looking for a
		sheet that has been given a HELP-SOURCE. This can
		be overridden by the application programmer.

		See the <BASIC-SHEET> class for the HELP-SOURCE:
		init-keyword.

--------------------------------------------------

Name:		FRAME-HELP-SOURCE-LOCATOR		[Open Generic Function]

Signature:	FRAME-HELP-SOURCE-LOCATOR FRAME SOURCE => LOCATOR

Arguments:	FRAME	<FRAME>		The frame help is being invoked on.
		SOURCE	<HELP-SOURCE>	The help source being used.

Values:		LOCATOR	<STRING>	The help file name to use.

Description:	Called by the system to determine the file to use for
		the frame and the help source. The default method
		returns #f. This can be overridden by the application
		programmer.

--------------------------------------------------

Name:		FRAME-HELP-CONTEXT			[Open Generic Function]

Signature:	FRAME-HELP-CONTEXT FRAME => CONTEXT

Arguments:	FRAME	<FRAME>		The frame help is being invoked on.

Values:		CONTEXT	<SYMBOL>	The help topic name to use.

Description:	Called by the system to determine the help topic to use
		for the frame. The default method searches up the
		sheet parent hierarchy from a given pane looking for a
		sheet that has been given a HELP-CONTEXT. This can
		be overridden by the application programmer.

		See the <BASIC-SHEET> class for the HELP-CONTEXT:
		init-keyword.

--------------------------------------------------

Name:		FRAME-HELP-KEYWORD			[Open Generic Function]

Signature:	FRAME-HELP-KEYWORD FRAME => KEYWORD

Arguments:	FRAME	<FRAME>		The frame help is being invoked on.

Values:		KEYWORD	<STRING>	The help text to use.

Description:	Called by the system to determine the help text to use
		for the frame. The default method searches up the
		sheet parent hierarchy from a given pane looking for a
		sheet that has some selected text. This can be
		overridden by the application programmer.

		See the generic function SELECTED-TEXT.

--------------------------------------------------

* MACROS

--------------------------------------------------

Name:		HELP-SOURCE-DEFINER			[Macro]

Signature:	DEFINE HELP-SOURCE NAME LOCATOR {CONTEXT => TOPIC-ID}* END

Arguments:	NAME	<SYMBOL>	The name of the help source.
		LOCATOR	<STRING>	The file name of the help source.
		CONTEXT	<SYMBOL>	A symbolic context name.
		TOPIC-ID<OBJECT>	A help system topic id.
		
Description:	Defines named help source, with a file name that
		contains the help information, and a set of
		translations from symbolic application names for
		the help topics to whatever the help system requires.
		
		The help-source name can be used as the value given
		to the HELP-SOURCE: init keyword for sheets, or it
		can be returned from an application-defined method
		on FRAME-HELP-SOURCE.

--------------------------------------------------

* EXAMPLE

The following example command table, that conforms to the Microsoft
Windows user interface design guidelines, is taken from the "helpmate"
example DUIM application:

define command-table *help-command-table* ()
  menu-item "&Context..." of <command> = make(<help-on-context>, pane: #"by-focus");
  menu-item "&Keyword..." of <command> = make(<help-on-keyword>, pane: #"by-focus");
  menu-item "&Topics..." of <command> = make(<help-on-topics>);
  menu-item "&Help on Help" of <command> = make(<help-on-help>);
  separator;
  menu-item "&About HelpMate" of <command> = make(<help-on-version>);
end command-table *help-command-table*;

See the source code of the "helpmate" example for more details
concerning the incorporation of the above into a simple
application. The application is slighly unconventional in that it
overrides the default help command initialization behaviour in order
to interactively supply the details from user input.
