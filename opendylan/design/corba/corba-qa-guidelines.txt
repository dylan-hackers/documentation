* INTRODUCTION

I'm assuming that QA folks will not be CORBA experts for some time so
mostly the testing will have to consist of double checking the test
suites on the trial releases and running through the worked example.

* INSTALLATION

The Enterprise edition should come with the following extra files:

	** IDL COMPILER

		(in Bin directory)

		console-scepter.exe
		tool-scepter.dll
		scepter.dll
		c-lexer.dll
		t-lists.dll

	** ORB RUNTIME

		(in Redistributable directory)

		d1orb.dll

		(or d2orb.dll or dxorb.dll depending on
		which release you are testing)

	** CORBA DEMOS

		(in Examples directory)

		corba/bank/bank/bank.idl
		corba/bank/bank/protocol/*.{dylan,hdp}
		corba/bank/bank/stubs/*.{dylan,hdp}
		corba/bank/bank/skeletons/*.{dylan,hdp}
		corba/bank/bank-client/*.{dylan,hdp}		
		corba/bank/bank-server/*.{dylan,hdp}

		corba/chat/hello.idl
		corba/chat/readme.htm
		corba/chat/client/*.{dylan,hdp}
		corba/chat/server/*.{dylan,hdp}
		corba/chat/protocol/*.{dylan,hdp}
		corba/chat/stubs/*.{dylan,hdp}
		corba/chat/skeletons/*.{dylan,hdp}

		corba/corba-hello-world/chat.idl
		corba/corba-hello-world/client/*.{dylan,hdp}
		corba/corba-hello-world/server/*.{dylan,hdp}
		corba/corba-hello-world/protocol/*.{dylan,hdp}
		corba/corba-hello-world/stubs/*.{dylan,hdp}
		corba/corba-hello-world/skeletons/*.{dylan,hdp}

* TEST SUITES

	** IDL COMPILER

Scepter (the IDL compiler) can be tested independently via some
TestWorks suites that compile and regurgitate a set of IDL files. You
just have to build and run an application called
console-scepter-tests.exe:

	checkout -rec D-corba-scepter-tests

	open <checkoutdir>\tests\console\console-scepter-tests.hdp

	build console-scepter-tests

	run console-scepter-tests.exe

The output should be a TestWorks style summary of suites, tests, and checks.

	** ORB RUNTIME

The ORB also has a test suite. This consists of both purely internal
tests that validate marshalling, or build and inspect data structures,
and external tests which use sockets to communicate with other
programs. 

	checkout -rec D-corba-tests

There is now no need to separately compile the IDL files using
console-scepter.exe. The IDL compiler is now linked into the main
build system and will automatically get invoked on IDL files.

	open <checkoutdir>\tests\dylan\client-app\corba-tests-client-app.hdp
	open <checkoutdir>\tests\dylan\client-app\corba-tests-server-app.hdp

	build corba-tests-client-app
	build corba-tests-server-app

Having built the test applications they can now be run in several modes:

		*** IN-PROCESS SERVER (OPTIMIZING FOR BEING IN-PROCESS)

	corba-tests-client-app.exe

		*** IN-PROCESS SERVER (NOT OPTIMIZING)

	corba-tests-client-app.exe -ORBno-co-location

		*** SEPARATE SERVER

	corba-tests-server-app.exe // starts server

	corba-tests-client-app.exe -ignore-suite collocated? // starts client-only

In each case the output should be a TestWorks style summary of suites,
tests, and checks.

* DEMOS

The Enterprise edition comes with some examples in a "CORBA" folder
node in the examples dialog. There are three pairs example
client/server projects. In each case both projects of each pair need
to be opened and built. Also the server uses an ODBC database to
persistently store bank account details (for a which a driver needs to
be installed, see the documentation).

Ideally QA should read and follow through the doc for the
demo/tutorial, but basically the steps are:

	ensure ODBC drivers installed (see doc)

	open bank-server
	open bank-client

	build bank-server
	build bank-client

	run bank-server
	run bank-client

	play with bank-client

Similarly for the other two demos:

	corba-hello-world
	chat

* DOCUMENTATION

The documentation now ships online with the product. There should be a
top level node in the contents tree control called "Functional Developer
CORBA User Guide".
