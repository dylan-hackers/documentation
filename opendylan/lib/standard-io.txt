	    Designed by Functional Objects, Inc. and the Gwydion Project

This document describes the Standard-io Library, which requires the Streams
Library.  The Standard-io Library exports one module, the Standard-io
Module.  All identifiers described in this document are exported from this
module:

*standard-input*						     [Variable]
*standard-output*						     [Variable]
*standard-error*						     [Variable]
   These variables are bound to streams that get input from a standard
   location for the platform on which the application is running, deliver
   normal output to a standard location, and deliver error output to a
   standard location for such messages.  If the platform has a notion of
   standard streams (or locations), these streams map onto those standard
   platform-specific streams.  If the platform has no such convention, such
   as a platform that is primarily windowing-based, there might be an
   implementation of this library that creates windows for these streams
   just to capture output to them, or to provide users with a place to
   provide input.

[WHEN WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THIS LIBRARY WILL DO FOR THE KANSAS
PRODUCT, WE WILL UPDATE THIS DOCUMENT TO REFLECT THOSE DECISIONS.]
