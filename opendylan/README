Open-sourcing note: I moved the contents of the DOCdylan CVS module into this
directory.  The DOCdylan module contained the user-visible documentation for
Functional Developer.  It is now in Dylan/doc/product and Dylan/doc/share.

This is a description of the re-org of the D-doc compounds. (See below
for progress report on what changes have taken place so far.)


D-doc organization:

		
			D-doc
       ___________________|_______________________________
       |       |    |       |        |      |        |   |
     design  user  lib  whitepaper  org  marketing  drm  README
       |       
   ____|_______________
   |           |      |
 compiler   runtime  env



D-doc-design contains all internal design documents.  It has some
subcompounds for things that have lots of documents.

D-doc-user contains all user-level documentation, except for "standard"
extended libraries.  Documents for things like the SCC environment go here.

D-doc-lib contains API-level documentation for all "standard"
libraries, that is, the libraries that we are trying to standardize on
between with other Dylan implementors.  This includes streams,
locators, FFI, etc.  (The internal design documents for these
libraries, should we ever write any, will go into D-doc-design-lib.)

D-doc-glue gets the Glue documents.

D-doc-whitepapers gets the white papers.

D-doc-org gets documents about the organization and process issues for
the dylan team. 

D-doc-marketing gets documents about marketing.

D-doc-drm gets documents about the Dylan Reference Manual.

D-doc-README is this document.
