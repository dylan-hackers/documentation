    <apiDesc>
      <p>Tells the compiler that it must consider the possibility of visible
      side effects from other threads at the point of the call.</p>

      <p>Normally, the compiler is not obliged to consider this
      possibility, and is free to rearrange program order provided
      that the reordering cannot be detected within a thread. </p>

      <p>Calling this function effectively prohibits the compiler from
      rearranging the order of reads or writes from or to global data,
      relative to the call. This function may disallow compiler
      optimizations, leading to less efficient code, even for
      strongly-ordered machines.</p>
