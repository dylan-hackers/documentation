    <apiDesc>
      <p>Calls <apioperation
      href="finalize.xml">finalize</apioperation> on each object that
      is awaiting finalization. </p>

      <p>Each call to <apioperation
      href="finalize.xml">finalize</apioperation> is made inside
      whatever dynamic handler environment is present when
      <apiname>drain-finalization-queue</apiname> is called. If the
      call to <apiname>drain-finalization-queue</apiname> is aborted
      via a non-local exit during a call to <apioperation
      href="finalize.xml">finalize</apioperation>, the finalization
      queue retains all the objects that had been added to it but
      which had not been passed to <apioperation
      href="finalize.xml">finalize</apioperation>.</p>

      <p>The order in which objects in the finalization queue will be
      finalized is not defined. Applications should not make any
      assumptions about finalization ordering.</p>
