  <title>Table-related Language Differences</title>

  <body>
    <p>For efficiency, Common Dylan adopts a slightly different table
    protocol than that described by the DRM. Hashing functions take an
    additional hash-state argument and merge it into the hash-state
    result. The function <apiname>merge-hash-codes</apiname> is
    replaced by <codeph>merge-hash-ids</codeph> because hash-states
    are merged as part of the hashing process. The constant
    <apiname>$permanent-hash-state</apiname> is no longer required (or
    provided); the same effect is achieved by returning the argument
    <apiname>hash-state</apiname> unchanged as the result
    <apiname>hash-state</apiname>. Finally,
    <codeph>object-hash</codeph> has been altered to use the new
    protocol.</p>
    
    <p>This section describes the items that have been changed. We
    also provide a <apiname>table-extensions</apiname> module in the
    <apiname>collections</apiname> library.</p>
