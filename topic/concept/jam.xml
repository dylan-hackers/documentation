    <p><xref href="http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html">Jam</xref> is
    a build tool designed by Christopher Seiwald, founder of <xref
    href="http://www.perforce.com/">Perforce Software</xref>. It is
    similar in some ways to <cmdname>make</cmdname>, the traditional
    Unix build tool. However, instead of using only simple declarative
    rules to define build targets and the dependencies between them,
    Jam contains a full scripting language, allowing build script
    authors to define high-level build instructions that match
    particular applications. The Jam program also includes Jambase, a
    library of rules (functions) for building executables and
    libraries from C, C++, and Fortran sources.</p>

    <p>The original Jam tool is a standalone program written in C and
    YACC. Peter Housel re-implemented the Jam language interpreter and
    build logic as a reusable Dylan library for use in the Open Dylan
    <codeph>build-system</codeph>.</p>
