  <title>DOOD Proxies</title>

  <conbody>
    <p>Sometimes users need more control over how objects are dumped to
    disk. DOOD provide a general mechanism called a proxy, which provides
    both a disk representation of an object and a reconstruction policy.
    The basic idea is that during the dumping process each memory object
    is given a chance to provide a disk object (a proxy) to be used for
    dumping and then upon loading, a loaded disk object is given a chance
    to map back to its original memory object. Proxies can be used for mapping
    objects back to unique runtime objects, for compressing objects, for
    looking up objects in external databases, etc.</p>
