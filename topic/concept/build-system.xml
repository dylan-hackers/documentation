  <title>Open Dylan Build System</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>The purpose of the Open Dylan <apiname>build-system</apiname>
    is to co√∂rdinate the final stages in the building of a Dylan
    library project. The Open Dylan compiler takes a Dylan library in
    the form of Dylan source files, and directly generates x86 or PPC
    machine language object files (in either COFF or ELF format,
    depending on the target platform). These object files need to be
    linked together to construct either an executable object file, or
    a loadable dynamically-linked library (also called a shared
    library). This link needs to performed by an external tool such as
    the Microsoft or GNU linker. The <apiname>build-system</apiname>
    component, controlled by a user-specified script file, directs the
    execution of these external tools.</p>
