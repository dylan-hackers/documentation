  <conbody>
    <p>A libraryâ€™s designer is responsible for documenting which
    features of the library offer built-in synchronization and which
    do not. While there is no definitive rule that can assist
    designers in this documentation, the following guidelines may be
    useful.</p>

    <p>If a client of the library forgets to use a synchronization
    feature when one is necessary, the library designer should ensure
    that the effect of the lack of synchronization is limited to a
    small unit&#x2014;probably a single object. In cases where the
    designer cannot guarantee that the effect will be limited, the
    library should either implement the synchronization internally, or
    provide a macro for clients to use instead.</p>

    <p>Library implementors must ensure that the library provides
    implicit synchronization for any hidden global state which is
    maintained by the library. Library designers may choose whether
    the library should offer implicit synchronization of the state of
    objects managed by the library.  The interface is more convenient
    if the synchronization is implicit, but it may be more efficient
    to rely on explicit synchronization by the client. Library
    designers should always document the choice they make.</p>
