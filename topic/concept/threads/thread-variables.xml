  <title>Thread variables</title>

  <conbody>
    <p>The Dylan threads facility provides a new type of variable: a
     <term>thread</term> variable, also known as a
     <term>thread-local</term> variable. These variables are similar
     to normal module variables in the sense that they are visible
     according to the same scoping rules and have the same semantics
     in a single-threaded program. However, in contrast to a normal
     variable, assignments to a thread variable in one thread are not
     visible when evaluating the variable in another thread.</p>

    <p>Whenever a thread is created, the value of each thread variable
    is initialized to a thread-independent value resulting from a
    once-only evaluation of the initialization expression of the
    thread variable definition.</p>

    <p>See FIXME page 103 for details of the
    <codeph>thread</codeph> adjective to <codeph>define
    variable</codeph>.</p>
