  <title>Thread safety in client libraries</title>

  <conbody>
    <p>If an application uses multiple threads, then there may be
    thread safety requirements for any library that can be called
    simultaneously by multiple threads, even if the called library
    does not use the Dylan threads facility directly.</p>
