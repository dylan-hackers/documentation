  <title>Multi-thread semantics</title>

  <conbody>
    <p>The Dylan Threads facility provides multiple threads of control
    within a single space of objects and module variables. Each thread
    runs in its own independent stack. The mechanism by which the
    threads are scheduled is not specified, and it is not possible to
    determine how the execution of instructions by different threads
    will be interleaved. No mechanism is provided to call a function
    on an existing thread other than the current thread. Neither is
    there a mechanism to signal an exception on a thread other than
    the current thread.</p>
