  <title>Ordering</title>

  <conbody>
    <p>The ordering of visibility of side effects performed in other
    threads is undefined, unless explicit synchronization is
    used. Implementations of the library may guarantee that the
    visibility of side-effects performed by another thread is ordered
    according to the control flow of the other thread (<term>strong
    ordering</term>), but multi-processor implementations might not be
    strongly ordered. Portable code should not assume strong ordering,
    and should use explicit synchronization where the order of side
    effects is important. There is currently no library introspection
    facility to determine if the implementation is strongly or weakly
    ordered.</p>
    
    <p>Because of the possibility of weak ordering, the compiler is
    free to assume that the effects of other threads may be ignored
    between explicit synchronization points, and it may perform any
    optimizations which preserve the semantics of a single-thread
    model regardless of their effects on other threads&#x2014;for
    example, common sub-expression elimination, or changing the order
    of evaluation.</p>
