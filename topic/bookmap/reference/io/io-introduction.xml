  <body>
    <p>This book provides reference documentation for the Open Dylan
    libraries and modules that support: printing and output formatting
    (including a streams module), interfaces to operating system
    features (such as the file system, time and date information, and
    the host machine environment), and network protocols and
    sockets.</p>

    <p>In general, each module is documented in a separate
    chapter.</p>
