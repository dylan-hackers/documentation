  CATALOG FILE FOR DYLANDOC

  DylanDoc is a set of extensions to DocBook which allow Dylan software to
  be documented without mangling it to fit the inadequate set of built-in
  DocBook entities. For example, Dylan functions can return multiple, named
  values, with or without type specifications. This and many other features
  of Dylan are handled poorly by DocBook.

  The DylanDoc distribution includes a series of DTD extensions which take
  advantage of DocBook's modularity by overriding certain entities and
  replacing them with Dylan-friendly versions.

  Also included are a series of extensions to Norman Walsh's modular
  DocBook DSSSL stylesheets. These allow DylanDoc documents to be
  translated to both HTML and various forms of printed material.

  Because installations of SGML-related toys tend to vary, you'll need to
  uncomment the section corresponding to your system or add a new section
  as needed.
