Class: <range>
==============================

The class of arithmetic sequences.

The class <range> is used for creating sequences of numbers. Ranges may be
infinite in size, and may run from higher numbers to lower numbers.

If size: is specified and none of to:, above: or below: is specified, then the
size: argument determines the size of the range.

If size: is specified and one of to:, above: or below: is specified, than it
is an error if the number of elements implied by the to:, above: or below:
argument (and the by: argument, if present) does not agree with the number of
elements specified by the size: argument.

Make keywords:

from:  - An instance of #<real># specifying the first value in the range. The
         default value is 0.

by:    - An instance of #<real># specifying the step between consecutive
         elements of the range. The default value is 1.

to:    - An instance of #<real># specifying an inclusive bound for the range.
         If by: is positive, the range will include numbers up to and
         including this value. If by: is negative, the range will include
         numbers down to to and including this value. to: cannot be specified
         with above: or below:.

above: - An instance of #<real># specifying an exclusive lower bound for the
         range. The range will only include numbers above this value,
         regardless of the sign of by:. above: cannot be specified with to: or
         below:.

below: - An instance of #<real># specifying an exclusive upper bound for the
         range. The range will only include numbers below this value,
         regardless of the sign of by:. below: cannot be specified with to: or
         above:.

size:  - An instance of #<integer># specifying the size of the range.
