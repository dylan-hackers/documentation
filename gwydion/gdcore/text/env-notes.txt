Title: Environment Notes
========================

This page discusses how Gwydion Dylan interacts with an operating system.



Topic: Debugger customizations
==============================

A note on terminology: We use the term "debugger" here in the loose, Dylan
sense of anything that handles an uncaught error. In Mindy, this debugger is
indeed a full fledged debugger, but in other Gwydion compilers it may not be.

The debugger uses the function #report-condition# to print conditions as error
messages to users; for example, this is the function that implements the %S
format-string directive for conditions. The debugger also uses the #format#
function exported from #Module format# to process format strings, and it
prints directly to the Unix STDOUT.

You can extend how the debugger prints conditions, change what formatting
function it uses, and direct where debugger output goes with the following:
- #report-condition#
- #condition-format#
- #condition-force-output#
- #*warning-output*#
