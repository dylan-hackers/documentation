Module: Module pprint
==============================

This module and the Print module implement most of the pretty printing
technology described by Richard C. Waters in _Common Lisp the Language_,
second edition. This section only summarizes the pretty printing functionality
to provide a quick reference for users of the Print module, and readers should
refer to the Common Lisp manual for more details.

When writing #print-object# methods, users can ignore whether pretty printing
is in effect. If you write your #print-object# method using pretty printing
functions, then when pretty printing is in effect, the output will be pretty
printed. When pretty printing is not in effect, your method will produce
output as though you had not written it to use pretty printing. All
#print-object# methods that are written to do pretty printing must call the
pretty printing functions within the dynamic scope of a call to
#pprint-logical-block#; otherwise, the pretty printing functions are no-ops.
