Macro: with-lock
==============================

Holds a lock while executing a body of code. If a _failure_ clause is
supplied, then it will be evaluated and its values returned from #with-lock#
if the lock cannot be claimed (because a timeout occurred). The default, if no
_failure_ clause is supplied, is to signal an exception of class
#<timeout-exceeded>#. If there is no failure, #with-lock# returns the results
of evaluating the body.
