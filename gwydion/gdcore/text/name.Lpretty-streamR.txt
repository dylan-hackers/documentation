target:       - An instance of #<stream>#. The stream where the output is
                finally going to go. Required.
                
line-length:  - An instance of #<integer>#. The line length for this stream.
                Defaults to #*default-line-length*#.
                
column:       - An instance of #<integer>#. The column the first character in
                the buffer will appear in. Normally zero, but if we end up
                with a very long line with no breaks in it we might have to
                output part of it. Then this will no longer be zero. Defaults
                to 0.
                
contents:     - An instance of #<sequence>#. Defaults to an empty #<vector>#.
                
outer-stream: - An instance of #<stream># or #f. Defaults to this instance.

direction:    - One of #"input", #"output", #"input-output". The default is
                #"input". This indicates whether the string is readable or
                writable or both.
                
element-type: - An instance of #<type>#. The type of each data element of the
                stream. The default is #<object>#.
                
start:        - ?
end:          - ?
