Macro: assert
==============================

Signals an error if assumption is incorrect.

This macro signals an error if _value_ is #f. Otherwise, it does nothing. It
may or may not evaluate its argument exactly once. So, it goes to follow that
users of #assert# should not have side-effects in the expression that is
passed to #assert# because if we ever turn assertions off, that would mean the
program runs differently in debug mode than it does in release mode.
