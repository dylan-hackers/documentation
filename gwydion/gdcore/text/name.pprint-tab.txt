Generic: pprint-tab
==============================

This function announces a tab to the pretty printer. _Colnum_ and _colinc_
have meaning based on the value of _kind_:

#"line" - Tab to output column _colnum_. If the output is already at or beyond
_colnum_, then add _colinc_ to _colnum_ until printing can continue at a
column beyond the end of the output already on the line.

#"line-relative" - Output _colnum_ spaces. Then output enough spaces to tab to
a column that is a multiple of _colinc_ from the beginning of the line.

#"section" - This is similar to #"line", but column counting is relative to
the beginning of the current section rather than the beginning of the line.

#"section-relative" - This is similar to #"line-relative", but column counting
is relative to the beginning of the current section rather than the beginning
of the line.
