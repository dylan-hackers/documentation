Function: collection-hash
==============================

A function for building hash functions that test collection equivalence. Two
collections will yield the same hash id if each of their key/element pairs
hash to the same value. It is only safe to set the _ordered:_ keyword argument
to #t if the collection has a natural iteration order.

Arguments:
------------------------------
key-hash      - An instance of #<function>#. Computes hash ids for the keys.
                It takes an object and a #<hash-state># as an argument, and
                returns a hash id and a hash state.

element-hash  - An instance of #<function>#. Computes hash ids for the
                elements. It takes an object and a #<hash-state># as an
                argument, and returns a hash id and a hash state.

col           - An instance of #<collection>#. 

initial-state - An instance of #<hash-state>#. 

ordered:      - An instance of #<boolean>#. Whether or not to do an ordered
                merge of the key/element hash codes. The default is #f.


Values:
------------------------------
hash-id    - An instance of #<integer>#. 
hash-state - An instance of #<hash-state>#.
