Generic: aref-setter
==============================

Sets the array element indicated by a set of indices.

Sets the element of _array_ indicated by _indices_ to the _new-value_ and
returns the _new-value_. _array_ is modified by this operation.

An error is signaled if the number of indices is not equal to the rank of the
array. An error is signaled if any of the indices are out of bounds for array.
An error is signaled if the array is limited to hold objects of a particular
type and the new value is not an instance of that type.

The method for #<array># calls #element-setter# on the array and new value,
using as the key the result of applying #row-major-index# to the array and
indices.
