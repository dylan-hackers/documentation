Function: function-arguments
==============================

Returns information about the arguments accepted by a function. This function
returns three values:

- _required-number_ is the number of required arguments accepted by the
  function.

- _rest-boolean_ indicates whether the function accepts a variable number of
  arguments.

- _kwd-sequence_ indicates whether the function accepts keyword arguments. If
  the value is #f then the function does not accept keyword arguments.
  Otherwise, the function does accept keyword arguments, and the value is
  either a collection of the keywords that are permissible for any call to the
  function, or the symbol #"all" if all keywords are permitted by the
  function.

Note that particular calls to a generic function may accept additional
keywords not included in the third value returned by #function-arguments#, by
virtue of their being recognized by applicable methods.
