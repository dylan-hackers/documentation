Function: regexp-position
==============================

Find the position of a regular expression inside a string. If the regexp is
not found, return #f, otherwise return a variable number of marks.

This function returns the index of the start of the regular expression in the
_big-string_, or #f if the regular expression is not found. As a second value,
it returns the index of the end of the regular expression in the _big-string_
(assuming it was found; otherwise there is no second value). These values are
called marks, and they come in pairs, a start-mark and an end-mark. If there
are groups in the regular expression, #regexp-position# will return an
additional pair of marks (a start and an end) for each group. If the group is
matched, these marks will be integers; if the group is not matched, the marks
will be #f. So

: regexp-position("This is a string", "is");
	    
returns values(2, 4) and

: regexp-position("This is a string", "(is)(.*)ing");
	    
returns values(2, 16, 2, 4, 4, 13), while

: regexp-position("This is a string", "(not found)(.*)ing");

returns #f. Marks are always given relative to the start of _big-string_, not
relative to the _start:_ keyword.

- #Module regular-expressions#


Arguments:
------------------------------
big-string      - An instance of #<string>#. The string to parse.
regexp          - An instance of #<string>#. 
start:          - An instance of #<integer>#. Where to start parsing the
                  string. The default is 0.
end:            - An instance of #<integer># or #f. If defined, where to stop
                  parsing the string. The default is #f.
case-sensitive: - An instance of #<object>#. If true, match case in regexp
                  while parsing. The default is #f.


Values:
------------------------------
regexp-start      - An instance of type-union(<integer>, <false>). If #f, a
                    match was not found. Otherwise, the index of the start of
                    the match.
                    
regexp-end        - An instance of #<integer>#. The index of the end of the
                    match. Not present if no match found.
                 
#rest group-marks - Instances of type-union(<integer>, <false>). The indices
                    of the start and end of each group's match. If a group is
                    not matched, its corresponding index values will be #f,
                    #f. None of these values will be present if a match to
                    the the regexp as a whole was not found.
