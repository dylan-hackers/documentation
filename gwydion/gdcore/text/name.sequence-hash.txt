Function: sequence-hash
==============================

Like #collection-hash#, only a more efficient version just for sequences. This
is similar to an #equal-hash# for the collection, except that it hashes things
with _ordered:_ #t and ignores the sequence keys.

_USE_WITH_CAUTION_: This isn't a proper #equal-hash# because two collections
of different types but identical key/element pairs won't generate the same
hash id, even though the two collections are =.

Arguments:
------------------------------
element-hash  - An instance of #<function>#. Computes hash ids for the
                elements. It takes an object and a #<hash-state># as the
                arguments, and returns a hash id and a hash state.
seq           - An instance of #<sequence>#. 
initial-state - An instance of #<hash-state>#. 


Values:
------------------------------
hash-id    - An instance of #<integer>#. 
hash-state - An instance of #<hash-state>#.
