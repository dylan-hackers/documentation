Class: <generic-function>
==============================

The class of functions that are made up of a number of individual methods.

The arguments describe the shape of the generic function's parameter list, and
thereby control which methods can be added to the generic function.

An error is signaled if the value of rest?: is true and the value of key: is a
collection. While a method parameter list may specify both #rest and #key, a
generic function parameter list cannot.

An error is signaled if the value of all-keys?: is true and the value of
key: is #f.

A new generic function initially has no methods. An error will be signaled if
a generic function is called before methods are added to it. Once a generic
function is created, you can give it behavior by adding methods to it with
#add-method# or define method (see #method-definer#).

Generic functions are not usually created by calling #make# directly. Most
often they are created by define generic (see #generic-definer#) or implicitly
by define method.

required:  - An instance of #<number># or #<sequence>#.
           
           - This argument represents the required arguments that the generic
             function accepts. If a sequence is supplied, the size of the
             sequence is the number of required arguments, and the elements of
             the sequence are the specializers. If a number is supplied, it is
             the number of required arguments, and the specializers default to
             #<object>#. If the argument is not supplied, or the supplied
             argument is neither a sequence nor a non-negative integer, an
             error is signaled.
           
rest?:     - An instance of #<boolean>#.
           
           - A true value indicates that the generic function accepts a
             variable number of arguments. The default value is #f.
           
key:       - #f or an instance of #<collection># whose elements are keywords.
           
           - If the value is a collection, then the generic function accepts
             keyword arguments, and the collection specifies the set of
             mandatory keywords for the generic function. A value of #f
             indicates that the generic function does not accept keyword
             arguments. The default value is #f.

all-keys?: - An instance of #<boolean>#.

           - A true value indicates that the generic function accepts all
             keyword arguments. The default value is #f.
