Class: <stretchy-collection>
==============================

The class of collections that may grow or shrinking to accommodate adding or
removing elements.

Stretchy collections allow #element-setter# to be called with a key that is
not present in the collection, expanding the collection as necessary to add a
new element in that case. Each concrete subclass of <stretchy-collection> must
provide or inherit a method for #element-setter# the behaves as follows when
there is not already an element present for the indicated key:
- If the class is a subclass of #<explicit-key-collection>#, adds a new
  element to the collection with the indicated key.
- If the class is a subclass of #<sequence>#, first calls #size-setter# on the
  key + 1 and the collection to expand the sequence. The key must be a
  non-negative integer.
