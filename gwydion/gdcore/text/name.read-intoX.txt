Generic: read-into!
==============================

Reads a group of elements from a stream into a collection.

Reads in _n_ elements from the stream starting from the the stream's current
position and places those elements into _sequence_. _sequence_ must be mutable
to allow it to expand should the streamed-in elements be larger than its
original size. Handles end-of-stream conditions just as #read-element# does.
