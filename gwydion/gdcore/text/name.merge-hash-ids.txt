Generic: merge-hash-ids
==============================

Returns a hash id created from the merging of two argument hash ids. This can
be used, for example, to generate a hash id for an object by combining hash
ids of some of its parts.

_id1_, _id2_, and _merged-id_ are all integers. _ordered_ is a boolean and
determines whether the algorithm used to perform the merge is permitted to be
order dependent. If false, which is the default, then the merged result must
be independent of the order in which the argument pairs are provided. If true,
then the order of the argument pairs matters because the algorithm used need
not be either commutative or associative. It is best to provide a true value
for ordered when possible, as this may result in a better distribution of hash
ids. However, ordered must only be true if this will not cause the hash
function to violate the second constraint on hash functions, described on page
123 of the _Dylan Reference Manual_.
