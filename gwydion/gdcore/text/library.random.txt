Library: Library Random
==============================

The Random library provides random number support in several random number
distributions. This is a replacement for David Pierce's Random library. This
one is strongly based on Common Lisp. Much of the implementation has been
translated from CMUCL's rand.lisp, which was written by David Adam. Code that
turns a uniform random distribution into Gaussian and exponential
distributions has been adapted from David Pierce's library.
