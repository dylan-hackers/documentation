Class: <simple-option-parser>
==============================

Parses options without any parameters. Simple options have no parameters, and
may appear in both positive and negative forms. When parsing a list of
arguments, _option-value_ is first set to the default. As the command line is
then scanned from left to right, each positive option sets the value to #t and
each negative option sets it to #f.

This behavior is consistent with that of the utility rm, which allows the
user to set default options with a shell alias of the form alias rm="rm -i".
Such defaults can be overridden by explicitly passing a flag when calling rm
because the rightmost value takes precedence.

-q, --quiet, -v, --verbose

default:	              - An instance of #<boolean>#. Specifies the value
                          returned by this option parser if no applicable

negative-short-options: - An instance of #<list>#. Specifies the negative
                          short options handled by this parser, represented as
