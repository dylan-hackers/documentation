Function: fill-table!
==============================

Fills a table with the keys and elements supplied.

This function interprets _keys-and-elements_ as key-element pairs, that is, it
treats the first element as a table key, the second as the table element
corresponding to that key, and so on. The keys and elements should be suitable
for table.

Because _keys-and-elements_ is treated as a sequence of paired key-element
values, it should contain an even number of elements; if it contains an odd
number of elements, #fill-table!# ignores the last element (which would have
been treated as a key).
