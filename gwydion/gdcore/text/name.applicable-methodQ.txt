Generic: applicable-method?
==============================

Tests if a function is applicable to sample arguments. Returns true if
_function_ is a method that would be applicable to _sample-args_ or if it is a
generic function that contains a method that would be applicable to
_sample-args_.

Note that if _function_ is a generic function, then calling it with the
_sample-args_ may still signal an error, even if #applicable-method?# returns
true. This is because the generic function may contain methods that are
ambiguous relative to the _sample-args_. See "Method Specificity" on page 96
of the _Dylan Reference Manual_ for a complete description of ambiguous
methods.

If _function_ is a sealed generic function, #applicable-method?# may signal an
error of type #<sealed-object-error>#.
