Generic: pprint-logical-block
==============================

Start a logical block, creating a #<pretty-stream># if necessary.

This function groups printing into a logical block. The logical block provides
boundaries for new levels of indentation, affects #"linear" newlines, and so
on.

_prefix_ is a string to print at the beginning of the logical block. The
block's indentation is automatically set to be one character position greater
than the column in which _prefix_ ends. Alternatively, _per-line-prefix_ is a
string to print on every line of the logical block. This function signals an
error if it is called with both _prefix_ and _per-line-prefix_ supplied.

_suffix_ is a string to print at the end of the logical block.

_column_ advises the pretty printer as to the current column of the output
stream. The _column_ argument may be ignored entirely by some methods, and it
may be ignored in some cases by methods that can better determine the stream's
current output column.

_body_ must be a #<function># that can take one argument, and this argument is
a #<stream>#. The _body_ function should use the stream argument passed to it;
the _body_ function should not close over the stream argument to
#pprint-logical-block#.

#pprint-logical-block# wraps _stream_ with a pretty printing stream when
_stream_ is any other kind of stream. If _stream_ is already a pretty printing
stream, then the _body_ function is called on _stream_.

All #print-object# methods that are written to do pretty printing must call
the other pretty printing functions within the dynamic scope of a call to
#pprint-logical-block#; otherwise, the pretty printing functions are no-ops.
