Module: Module self-organizing-list
==============================

The self-organizing list, or skip list, is a poor man's hash table. More
precisely, #<self-organizing-list># is a subclass of
#<mutable-explicit-key-collection># and #<stretchy-collection># for which
addition and retrieval are both linear in the worst case, but which use a
probabilistic strategy which yields nearly constant time in the best case.

Because they have a very low overhead, self-organizing lists may provide
better performance than hash tables in cases where references have a high
degree of temporal locality. They may also be useful in situations where it is
difficult to create a proper hash function.

Instantiate #<self-organizing-list>#s with

: make(<self-organizing-list>, test: test)

_Test_ is expected to be an equality function. In particular, it is expected
to satisfy the identity and transitivity requirements as described in the
_Dylan Reference Manual_. If not specified, test defaults to \==.
