Class: <case-insensitive-string-table>
==============================

Implements a #<table># class, keyed by strings keyed without regard for case.

#<case-insensitive-string-table># implements a #<table># class whose keys are
instances of #<string>#. However, instead of using #=# for the equivalence
relation, strings which are the same aside from case are considered
equivalent.

Note that the case-insensitivity is true in general only for English strings â€”
non-English characters have their case "normalized" by subtracting the
difference in integer code for the character 'a' and 'A'. This works only for
ASCII and Unicode, and only for English.

size: - An instance of #<integer>#. If specified, this value provides a hint
        to the implementation as to the expected number of elements to be
        stored in the table, which is be used to control how much space to
        initially allocate for the table.
