Generic: key-sequence
==============================

Returns a sequence containing the keys of its collection argument.

Although elements may be duplicated in a collection, keys, by their nature,
must be unique; two different elements in a collection may not share a common
key, even though distinct keys may yield identical elements.

The order in which the keys from _collection_ appear in the key sequence is
unspecified if _collection_ is unstable under iteration. In particular,
different calls to #key-sequence# with the same argument may yield differently
ordered key sequences. If _collection_ is stable under iteration, however, the
resulting sequence of keys will be in the natural order for _collection_.
