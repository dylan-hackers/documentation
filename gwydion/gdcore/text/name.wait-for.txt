Generic: wait-for
==============================

Blocks until a synchronization object is available.

This function is the basic blocking primitive of the Threads library. It
blocks until _object_ is available and synchronization can be achieved, or the
timeout interval has expired. A non-blocking synchronization may be attempted
by specifying a timeout of zero. Individual methods may adjust the state of
the synchronization object on synchronization. The function returns #t if
synchronization is achieved before the timeout interval elapses; otherwise it
returns #f.

Arguments:
------------------------------
object   - An instance of #<synchronization>#. 
timeout: - An instance of type-union(<false>, <real>). Time-out interval. If
           #f, the time-out interval never elapses. Otherwise, the #<real>#
           value corresponds to the desired interval in seconds. The default
           is #f.


Values:
------------------------------
success - An instance of #<boolean>#. 



Method: wait-for
==============================

Claims a read-write lock, blocking if necessary. The behavior depends on the value of _mode_:

#"read"  - If there is a write lock, blocks until the lock becomes free. Then
           claims the lock by incrementing its internal read-lock counter.

#"write" - First waits until the lock becomes free, by blocking if necessary.
           Then claims exclusive ownership of the lock in write mode. If the
           claim is successful, this method returns true; otherwise it returns
           false.
           

Arguments:
------------------------------
object   - An instance of #<read-write-lock>#. 
timeout: - An instance of type-union(<false>, <real>). Time-out interval. If
           #f, the time-out interval never elapses. Otherwise, the #<real>#
           value corresponds to the desired interval in seconds. The default
           is #f.
mode:    - One of #"read", #"write". The default is #"read".
