Class: <abort>
==============================

The class of conditions used to terminate a computation.

Handlers are expected to terminate execution of the current application
command, or similar unit of execution, and return control to something like an
application command loop. This is comparable to command-period on the
Macintosh. The exact details of this feature depend on the particular
environment, of course, but signaling an instance of <abort> is a uniform way
to "get out."
