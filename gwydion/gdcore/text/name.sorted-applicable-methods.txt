Function: sorted-applicable-methods
==============================

Returns all the methods in a generic function that are applicable to sample
arguments, sorted in order of specificity.

Returns two sequences that, taken together, contain the methods in
_generic-function_ that are applicable to the _sample-args_. _sorted-methods_
contains methods that are more specific than every method that follows them.
_unsorted-methods_ begins at the first point of ambiguity; it contains the
methods that cannot be sorted.

The sequences returned should never be destructively modified. Doing so may
cause unpredictable behavior.

If _generic-function_ is sealed, an implementation may choose not to return
two sequences of methods, but instead signal an error of type
#<sealed-object-error>#.

Arguments:
------------------------------
generic-function - An instance of #<generic-function>#. 
#rest sample-args - Instances of #<object>#. 


Values:
------------------------------
sorted-methods   - An instance of #<list>#. Elements of the list are instances
                   of <method>.
unsorted-methods - An instance of #<list>#. Elements of the list are instances
                   of <method>.
