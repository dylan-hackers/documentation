Generic: direct-superclasses
==============================

Returns the direct superclasses of a class. These are the classes that were
passed as arguments to #make# or define class (see #class-definer#) when the
class was created. The order of the classes in the _sequence_ is the same as
the order in which they were passed to define class or #make# when _class_ was
created.

The result _sequence_ should never be destructively modified. Doing so may
cause unpredictable behavior. If class is sealed, an implementation may choose
to signal an error of type #<sealed-object-error># rather than returning the
direct superclasses.
