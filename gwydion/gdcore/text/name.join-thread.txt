Function: join-thread
==============================

Waits for another, existing, thread to terminate, by blocking if necessary,
and then returns the values of its function. The function returns the thread
object that was joined, along with any values its function returns.

If more than one thread is passed to #join-thread#, the current thread blocks
until the first of those threads terminates. The values returned are those of
the first thread to terminate.

If one or more of the multiple threads has already terminated at the time of
the call, then one of those terminated threads is joined. When more than one
thread has already terminated, it is undefined which of those threads the
implementation will join.

It is an error to pass a thread to #join-thread# if it has already been joined
in a previous call to #join-thread#. It is an error to pass a thread to
#join-thread# if that thread is also being processed by another simultaneous
call to #join-thread# from another thread.
