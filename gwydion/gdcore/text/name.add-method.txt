Function: add-method
==============================

Adds a method to a generic function.

Programs do not commonly call #add-method# directly. It is called by define
method (see #method-definer#).

If you add a method to a generic function, and the generic function already
has a method with the exact same specializers, then the old method is replaced
with the new one.

A single method may be added to any number of generic functions.

#add-method# returns two values. The first is the new _method_. The second
will be either the method in _generic-function_ that is being replaced by
_method_, or it will be #f if no method is being replaced.

#add-method# may signal an error of type #<sealed-object-error># if adding the
method or replacing an existing method would cause a sealing violation.

If _generic-function_ is sealed, or if _method_ is in a sealed domain of
_generic-function_, then an error of type #<sealed-object-error># is signaled.
