Generic: condition-format
==============================

This function serves as a firewall between the condition system and the
Streams and Format modules. Methods on #report-condition# should use
#condition-format# to do their formatting. Users will generally use
#*warning-output*# for the _stream_ argument, but this is not required.

The Extensions module supplies a method for when _stream_ is #"Cheap-Err" or
#"Cheap-IO". The Gwydion Format module supplies a method for when _stream_ is
a subclass of #<stream>#. If you are implementing your own streams or format
libraries, you will need to define a method on #condition-format# for your
type of stream.

                  condition.
