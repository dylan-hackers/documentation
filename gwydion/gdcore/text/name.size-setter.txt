Generic: size-setter
==============================

Sets the size of an object. _object_ is modified by this operation.

Methods are provided for stretchy sequences; that is, for collections that are
instances both of #<stretchy-collection># and of #<sequence>#.

#size-setter# sets the size of a stretchy sequence to be _new-size_. The
stretchy sequence is modified by this operation. If _new-size_ is less than or
equal to the original size of the stretchy sequence, then the first _new-size_
elements of the stretchy sequence are retained at the same positions. If
_new-size_ is greater than the original size of the stretchy sequence, then
the previous elements of the stretchy sequence are retained at the same
positions, and enough new elements are added to reach the new size. The value
of each new element is the same as would have been used if the stretchy
sequence had been created with #make#, specifying size: _new-size_ but not
fill:.

It is not specified how #size-setter# adds new elements to the stretchy
sequence. In particular, it is not required to call #add!# or any other
predefined function.
