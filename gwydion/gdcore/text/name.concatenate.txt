Generic: concatenate
==============================

Returns a sequence containing all the elements of all the sequences, in order.

The _result-sequence_ will be an instance of the #type-for-copy# value for
_first-sequence_. It may or may not be freshly allocated. The
_result-sequence_ may be created by calling #make# on the indicated type, with
a size: initialization argument whose value is the sum of the sizes of the
argument sequences. (For this reason, the #type-for-copy# value of
_first-sequence_ must support the size: init-keyword.)

_result-sequence_ may share structure with any of the argument sequences, but
it is not guaranteed to do so. The argument sequences will not be modified by
this operation.
