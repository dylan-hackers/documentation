Generic: remove!
==============================

Removes an element from a sequence, possibly modifying the sequence.

Returns a sequence consisting of the elements of _source-sequence_ not equal
to _value_. The _result-sequence_ may or may not be freshly allocated, may or
may not be == to the _source-sequence_, and may or may not share structure
with the _source-sequence_. The _source-sequence_ may be modified by
#remove!#.

_test_ is a function that determines whether an element is equal to _value_.
The test function may be non-commutative: it is always called with an element
from _source-sequence_ as its first argument and _value_ as its second
argument.

If _count_ is #f, then all copies of value are removed. Otherwise, no more
than _count_ copies of value are removed (so additional elements equal to
_value_ might remain in _result-sequence_).
