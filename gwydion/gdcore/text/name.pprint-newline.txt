Generic: pprint-newline
==============================

This function announces a conditional newline to the pretty printer. The
pretty printer emits a newline depending on the kind and the state of the
pretty printer's current line buffer. The _kind_ argument has roughly the
following meanings:

#"fill" - Emit a newline if the current section of output does not fit on one
line.

#"linear" - Emit a newline if any #"linear" newline in the current section
needs to be emitted. That is, if a current section of output cannot fit on one
line, and any one of the #"linear" newlines in the section needs to be
emitted, then emit them all.

#"miser" - Emit a newline as if it were a #"linear" newline, but only when
miser mode is in effect. Miser style is in effect when a logical block starts
past a particular column of output.

#"mandatory" - Emit a newline always. Establish that any containing sections
cannot be printed on a single line so that #"linear" and #"miser" newlines
will be emitted as appropriate.
