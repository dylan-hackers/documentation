Title: Introduction
===================

These pages serve as a guide to the libraries included with Gwydion Dylanâ„¢.

Skeleton pages were created using the Dylan-to-NaturalDocs toolkit at
http://homepage.mac.com/d_j_v/FileSharing5.html and Dustin Voss filled in the
details by hand consulting source code and other references.

To contribute, edit the text files found in the Dylan Subversion repository at
trunk/documentation/gwydion/gdcore. Upon check-in, these pages should
regenerate automatically.
