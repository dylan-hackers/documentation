Generic: condition-force-output
==============================

Flushes the condition output stream. #condition-force-output# forces any
pending output from _stream_'s buffer to _stream_'s destination. This function
is invoked by the debugger after a condition has been reported and before it
pauses for user input. Unless you are writing a debugger, you do not need to
call #condition-force-output# yourself.

The Extensions module supplies a method for when _stream_ is #"Cheap-IO" or
#"Cheap-Err". The Gwydion Format module supplies a method for when _stream_ is
a subclass of #<stream>#. If you are implementing your own streams or format
libraries, you will need to define a method on #condition-force-output# for
your type of stream.
