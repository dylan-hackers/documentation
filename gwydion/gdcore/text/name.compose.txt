Function: compose
==============================

Returns the composition of one or more functions.

When called with just a single argument, #compose# returns that argument.

When called with two arguments, #compose# returns a function that applies the
second function to its arguments and then applies the first function to the
(single) result value.

With three or more arguments, #compose# composes pairs of argument functions,
until a single composite function is obtained. (It doesn't matter if the
pairings are done from the left or from the right, as long as the order of
application is preserved.)
