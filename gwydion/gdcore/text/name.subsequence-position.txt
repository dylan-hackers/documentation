Generic: subsequence-position
==============================

Returns the position where a pattern appears in a sequence.

Searches _big_ for a subsequence that is element-for-element equal to
_pattern_, as determined by the _test_ argument.

_test_ is applied to elements of successive subsequences of _big_ and
corresponding elements of the _pattern_ to determine whether a match has
occurred. If a subsequence is found, #subsequence-position# returns the index
at which the subsequence starts; otherwise, it returns #f. If there is more
than one match, _count_ determines which subsequence is selected. A _count_ of
1 (the default) indicates that the first match should be returned.
