Class: <array>
==============================

The class of sequences whose elements are arranged according to a Cartesian
coordinate system.

An array element is referred to by a (possibly empty) series of indices. The
length of the series must equal the range of the array. Each index must be a
non-negative integer less than the corresponding dimension. An array element
may alternatively be referred to by an integer, which is interpreted as a
row-major index.

Arrays typically use space efficient representations, and the average time
required to access a randomly chosen element is typically sublinear to the
number of elements.

When a single-dimensional array is created, the array created will be an
instance of #<vector>#.

Each concrete subclass of <array> must either provide or inherit
implementations of the functions element, element-setter, and dimensions.

Make keywords:
------------------------------
dimensions: - An instance of #<sequence># with elements that are instances of
              #<integer>#. This argument specifies the dimensions of the
              array. The size of the sequence specifies the rank (number of
              dimensions) of the array, and each integer in the sequence
              specifies the size of a dimension. This argument is required.

fill:       - An instance of #<object># specifying an initial value for each
              element of the array. The default value is #f.
