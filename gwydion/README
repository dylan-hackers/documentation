This directory contains files documenting CMU's Gwydion Dylan 2.0. This is
very much a work in progress. To make the HTML versions, you'll need to
install the Cygnus DocBook tools.

For more information, contact eric.kidd@pobox.com.

These files are copyright on various dates by various people. It would
probably be unwise to copy them without talking to me first. We'll sort out
the licensing soon and put everything under a suitable free license.

DocBook tools, principally db2html, are available in source and i386 form at
ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/home/rosalia/docware/

The docbook rpm requires the sgml-common rpm, which is available in the same
directory.  DocBook for other platforms was found in the usual places.

For editing the docs, there is a DocBook tutorial available at
http://nis-www.lanl.gov/~rosalia/mydocs/docbook-intro.html

We'll be moving to sgml-tools 2.x in the foreseeable future.
